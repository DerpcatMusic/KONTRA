# Native paired round3 handoff

NEW exclusive checkout `/home/derpcat/.t3/worktrees/KONTAKTO/native-pair-round3`,

Delivered old native/DSP/integration worktrees and all other dirty work unchanged.

70005b680de9fffa2e218a9d6edc4e448b1925e8 required test clock/voice/heap fixes.
Do NOT compile1544 alone. Do NOT cherry-pick old historical whole branches.

No product clock change. KSP audio index15=elapsed16; quarter index1199=elapsed1200.
Added synchronous/default-Linear control at origins0/128; corrected direct DSP
helper from zero to one reserved voice plus voice assertion. External heap test
reuses existing approved support harness, no new unsafe/library allocator.

Full exact source/reference/test/limitations/next-cycle requests:
`docs/audit-2026-10-10/native-pair-round3.md`.
Next verified explicit-path NKA gap, traced independent of scout:
`docs/audit-2026-10-10/nka-explicit-path-next.md`.
Non-UI array identity currently erased into Host arg0=0: a plugin handler alone
cannot solve the missing file service. Init queues instead of loading synchronously.
Source-only follow-up inspected; no NKA product code or tests added to this pair.

Checks: conflict-free assembly, rustfmt syntax/targeted formatting, diff-check,
source coverage/admission/clock/capacity checks, immutable official-doc hashes,
independent exponential fixture discriminant. Rust UNRUN. Compile-ready SOURCE
is NOT compiler GREEN. Native clock/coefficients/runtime/CPU/RAM UNKNOWN.
No cargo/rustc/clippy/build/nativehost/reader/Wine/install/publication/server/probe,
no target/wrapper environment overrides, no AR admission/broad wiring or nested
agents/schedules. Integration owns one global future combined cycle.

Targeted filters: core lib kontakt_812_, legacy_linear_fade_keeps_bit_order_and_state_size,
fade_curve_; core integration --test fade_curves; ksp compile/params fade_curve_ then
complete params; uvi --test lua_compatibility. Pin combined SHA/artifacts/receipts.

NEXT: coordinator/integration validate full pair; report actual failures before
changing runtime. Coordinator may route narrow explicit-path NKA service separately.
Complete polished product and lower CPU AND RAM than both v1 and Kontakt remains
UNACHIEVED; neither source changes nor prepared heap checks establish that goal.
