# Native baseview dependency provenance

Copied from MUI `822b1922ad1872aaee15b371a31410b0f3580b88` alongside
`vendor/moose-baseview`, whose manifest uses these sibling path dependencies.
Original licenses and attribution are retained.

The only source departures are whitespace normalization in
`xim-parser/Cargo.toml` (extra final blank line) and
`xim-parser/xim-format.yaml` (trailing whitespace). No IME behavior changes.

Malformed compound text returns `InvalidReply` before commit or synchronous
acknowledgement; reset callbacks propagate their errors. The client regression
tests cover both trust boundaries.
