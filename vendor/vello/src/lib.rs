//! Vello is a 2d graphics rendering engine written in Rust, using [`wgpu`].
//! It efficiently draws large 2d scenes with interactive or near-interactive performance.
//!
//! ![image](https://github.com/linebender/vello/assets/8573618/cc2b742e-2135-4b70-8051-c49aeddb5d19)
//!
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Vello is meant to fill the same place in the graphics stack as other vector graphics renderers like [Skia](https://skia.org/), [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), and its predecessor project [Piet](https://www.cairographics.org/).
//! On a basic level, that means it provides tools to render shapes, images, gradients, texts, etc, using a PostScript-inspired API, the same that powers SVG files and [the browser `<canvas>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).
//!
//! Vello's selling point is that it gets better performance than other renderers by better leveraging the GPU.
//! In traditional PostScript-style renderers, some steps of the render process like sorting and clipping either need to be handled in the CPU or done through the use of intermediary textures.
//! Vello avoids this by using prefix-scan algorithms to parallelize work that usually needs to happen in sequence, so that work can be offloaded to the GPU with minimal use of temporary buffers.
//!
//! This means that Vello needs a GPU with support for compute shaders to run.
//!
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! Vello is meant to be integrated deep in UI render stacks.
//! While drawing in a Vello [`Scene`] is easy, actually rendering that scene to a surface setting up a wgpu context, which is a non-trivial task.
//!
//! To use Vello as the renderer for your PDF reader / GUI toolkit / etc, your code will have to look roughly like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Initialize wgpu and get handles
//! let (width, height) = ...;
//! let device: wgpu::Device = ...;
//! let queue: wgpu::Queue = ...;
//! let mut renderer = Renderer::new(
//!    &device,
//!    RendererOptions {
//!       use_cpu: false,
//!       antialiasing_support: vello::AaSupport::all(),
//!       num_init_threads: NonZeroUsize::new(1),
//!    },
//! ).expect("Failed to create renderer");
//!
//! // Create scene and draw stuff in it
//! let mut scene = vello::Scene::new();
//! scene.fill(
//!    vello::peniko::Fill::NonZero,
//!    vello::Affine::IDENTITY,
//!    vello::Color::from_rgb8(242, 140, 168),
//!    None,
//!    &vello::Circle::new((420.0, 200.0), 120.0),
//! );
//!
//! // Draw more stuff
//! scene.push_layer(...);
//! scene.fill(...);
//! scene.stroke(...);
//! scene.pop_layer(...);
//!
//! let texture = device.create_texture(&...);
//! // Render to a wgpu Texture
//! renderer
//!    .render_to_texture(
//!       &device,
//!       &queue,
//!       &scene,
//!       &texture,
//!       &vello::RenderParams {
//!          base_color: palette::css::BLACK, // Background color
//!          width,
//!          height,
//!          antialiasing_method: AaConfig::Msaa16,
//!       },
//!    )
//!    .expect("Failed to render to a texture");
//! // Do things with surface texture, such as blitting it to the Surface using
//! // wgpu::util::TextureBlitter.
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`examples/`](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples) folder to see how that code integrates with frameworks like winit.
