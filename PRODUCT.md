# Product
<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform
Native Linux audio plugin and standalone application.

## Stack
Rust, MOOSE plugin framework, MUI native editor. Reuse Kontakt container and NCW decoders.

## Users
The owner of the local Kontakt libraries, composing and playing instruments in a Linux DAW.

## Product Purpose
Build a native multisampler that can load existing Kontakt instruments, combine them into multis, route MIDI and audio, and play their samples. Compatibility must be measured against real instruments, not inferred from file extensions.

## Operating Context
Local library root: `/mnt/MAIN_STORAGE/Libraries/Kontakt`. Vista and Pacific Ensemble Strings are the first compatibility targets. Library files are read-only inputs.

## Capabilities and Constraints
CLAP, VST3, standalone. Clear diagnostics for missing samples and unsupported behavior. Small implementation using existing framework facilities. Full Kontakt behavior is the requested destination, not an established capability.

## Delegated Decisions
User requested complete autonomy. Working name: Kontakto. User-pinned direction: a clean native interface closely resembling Kontakt and KODA Sampler, with intrinsic layout, automatic alignment, a right-side artwork browser, multi-instrument rack and black-and-white keyboard. The user explicitly rejects navy/gold surfaces, excess spacing, rounding and fixed-position shells.
