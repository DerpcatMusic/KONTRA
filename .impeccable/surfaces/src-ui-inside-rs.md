## Direction contract
THESIS: Expose the instrument's sample mapping and overlapping alternatives as one readable workbench, with selection shared between Sound and the existing Mapping shortcut.
OWN-WORLD: Extend DESIGN.md's Graphite Rack: flat graphite planes, Noto Sans, square surfaces and hairlines. Functional group hues match map and list; selection stays neutral.
STORY: Filter groups, point at a key/velocity cell, inspect its layers and RR takes, select a sample and read its playback boundaries. Holding auditions through existing instrument routing. Source IR remains read only.
FIRST VIEWPORT: Sound tab strip above a compact group rail and key/velocity map; overlap rows directly below, then selected sample properties and waveform with start/end/loop markers. Two native plugin sizes: 1180×780 and 900×640.
FORM: Existing sampler workbench extension (incumbent Graphite Rack, no seed roll; seed key: incumbent-graphite-rack). Koda docs inform interaction only; no borrowed artwork or code.
FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its provenance
