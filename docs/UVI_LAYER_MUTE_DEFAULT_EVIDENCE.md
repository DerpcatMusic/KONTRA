# Missing Layer mute default

Retained authored Workstation 4.0.9 loaded-program getter observations return
Boolean `false` for omitted Layer `Mute`. Program, Keygroup and SamplePlayer
return nil in those observations. The shared `host::source_parameters` baseline
now inserts false only for an omitted Layer attribute; explicit XML values and
types retain precedence. The renderer already handles Layer Mute and its gates
are unchanged. No initial command or saved-state delta is created.

Both cached Clarinet inventories already retain Mute on all three Layers each.
This corrects an authored missing-property case, not a witnessed bank failure.
The same native receipt returns false for Part, whose synthetic emulator context
still has no owned Mute property. Prepared parent-absence assertions preserve
that existing ownership policy; they do not establish complete native getter
parity. Native nil results likewise do not prove the emulator's missing-property
errors. No parent, MPE, setter-lifecycle or audio-fidelity coverage is added.

Shared state capture/validation/preload uses the same Layer default. Original
graph identity is unchanged; newly saved omitted-property overrides cannot
validate in older implementations lacking it. Prepared getter/type/default-save
and Boolean override/restore checks remain uncompiled and unrun under the CPU
restriction. Independent static review is complete; final integration and actual
bank callback/audio verification remain pending. Installed binaries are unchanged.
