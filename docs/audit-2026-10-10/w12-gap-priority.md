# W12 format, family and slot recovery

Shipping source reviewed: `f199980d` (393). The private 383 batch is a separate
source candidate. This recovery uses existing receipts; it does not relabel
the old native census as a current shipping run.

The complete native Kontakt slot inventory has **834 items** on `5172a9ef`.
The remaining **660 UVI items are UNKNOWN** at the reader boundary; all 26
bank files exist. Its enabled/bypassed losses are FX slots 459/1037, filters
1799/545, modulator sources 158209/2685, and target routes 222757/18054.
These are separate units. `NativeLawUnverified` denotes approximation, not
a dropped slot or a native-audio pass.

Rank by audible impact and established advantage over v1:

| Priority | Recorded loss / evidence | v1 comparison and next action |
|---|---|---|
| Whole-item admission | 660 UVI inventories UNKNOWN; supplied legacy XML NKI 1/784 | Reader failure is not proven missing data. UVI belongs to W10; v1 also lacks XML-to-IR. Neither is a verified v1 port win in this receipt. |
| Sounding modulation / source behavior | Conflux intensity 64974 and frequency 37128 enabled target losses; RandomBipolar 28050 and LFO6 9282 enabled source losses | Largest historical sounding queue. V1 retains module assignments but does not execute all these laws; `src/modulation.rs` explicitly refuses externally driven LFOs. Do not claim v1 playback support from retained metadata. W6/W15 own the laws. |
| Sounding filters / FX | Filter30 876/17, Filter3 556/0, Filter106 267/16; Surround Panner 174/471 | Historical revision/kernel admission losses. Recount W15's newer READY blocks before calling these current defects. |
| Verified v1 resource-resolution mechanism | Convolution ResourceUnavailable 13/7 across Areia, Conflux and Una Corda | `0cb7a8a0:src/import.rs:918` maps an authored Resources suffix into the special-file-table NKR. Shipping v2 discards that table and only performs sample lookup. W12 owns the failing-first resolver port; actual recovered slot count requires affected-item measurement. |
| Family / cursor evidence | Cluster Risers 3 historical MATCH cells, 63 SCRIPT_DRIVEN UNKNOWN; priority Una Corda/Conflux 104 scripted programs UNKNOWN | RR is evaluated by support/distribution, never exact hit order. Cluster Risers is separate from Trills, whose held-key audition requires independent capture. Script group masks and scripted offsets do not prove executed samples/cursors. |
| Bypassed slots / unassigned format fields | Counts above; NIS controller-assignment properties and filename tails remain semantically unverified | Bypassed drops still prevent enabling native features. Nonzero bytes or object presence are not activation counts. Existing program-private script automation must not be mislabeled absent because NIS properties are opaque. |

The v1 resource mechanism is the first confirmed v1 advantage in W12's reader
scope. The larger DSP queues remain ahead by theoretical impact, with no
invented v1 superiority or new current totals.

Comparable historical **22-item** admission measurements are available:

| Dropped slots | Original enabled/bypassed | Last measured enabled/bypassed |
|---|---|---|
| FX | 377/1521 | 100/1315 |
| Filter | 2109/4962 | 1818/4770 |
| Modulator | 20404/24478 | 14960/24478 |

Last measured source is `5172a9ef`: four affected items/five programs were
remeasured, 18 unchanged receipts retained, authored identities/states matched,
and no new drops appeared. Recovered admission remains approximated. This is
not an eight-hour before/current comparison: no matched native-slot endpoint
on `f199980d` survives in W12's receipts. No current coverage percentage or
eight-hour improvement is certified. EQ's cached 18818 gain-route candidates
are projections, not measurements, and are excluded from the table.

Vista/Pacific **56/56, zero translated sample/IR failures** remains established
on `54d9a5c5`. Corrected taxonomy earns no new resolution or playback gain.
The four tester reader classes and compact snapshot fixtures already have
READY RED/GREEN receipts; exact absent tester files remain unverified.

target-summary.json,target-summary-after-42062adc.json,native-family-metrics.json,

`w12-format-revisions/legacy-header-census.json`, and
`w12-vista-pacific-resources/RESOURCE_CENSUS.json` under the run ledger.

The authored NKR resolver port is now measured on six native NKIs (176869
unchanged zones). Conflux recovers one impulse entry and Una Corda Cotton,
Felt and Pure recover three each. Those four items have zero translated
resource failures. Across the six items, failures fall from 20 to 10 and
admitted impulse entries rise from 0 to 10. The two Areia legacy octave
legatos retain five failures each; they are not credited as fixed.

The repaired hierarchical NKR fixture decodes independently before asserting
the fallback. The original resolver then produces RED (`None` versus the
authored member); the port passes all six sample tests and the Kontakt area
no-run after the build cutoff. Earlier shared-target and malformed-fixture
attempts are excluded. Ordinary lookup retains precedence, moved authored
containers and case differences work, and traversal and ambiguous containers
remain typed errors. Modern and legacy instrument/multi tables retain authored
NKR references. Legacy multi native playback is not measured.

Product metadata already includes the importer source hash in its stamp;
the changed resolver invalidates old translations. Recipes retain virtual NKR
member paths and the existing decoder reconstructs PCM in memory. No new
sample or decrypted payload is persisted. This measures resource admission,
not convolution DSP laws, slot activation, audio parity, or load timing.
The native paired receipt and cutoff verification are under
`w12-impulse-nkr-20261010/{PAIRED,BASELINE_VERIFIED,READY}.json`.

Pacific Trills and Vista FFF Overlay image lookup is a separate open item.
Their shared failed request identity and successful decode counts narrow the
cause to lookup, but exact request names and the frozen-v1 pair are pending.
The prior `b7d9a114` slice changed diagnostic taxonomy only and contains no
image resolver fix. A root FileContainer marker eligibility lead is not linked
to those native failures and earns no improvement claim.

NEXT: exact Pacific/Vista picture request and frozen-v1 pair, then general
lookup regression; retain Areia and native family/DSP evidence as open gaps.
